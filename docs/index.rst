``browser-history`` documentation
===========================================

``browser-history`` is a simple, zero-dependencies, developer-friendly python
package to retrieve (almost) any browser's history on (almost) any platform.

Check out the :ref:`quick_start` to get started.

This project relies on contributions made by other people especially for browsers
other than Chrome, Firefox and Safari and for platforms other than Windows, Mac
and Linux. As such, if you notice any issues or if there is no support for your browser
or platform, please open an issue on `the GitHub Page <https://github.com/pesos/browser-history>`_
